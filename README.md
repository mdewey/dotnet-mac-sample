## Intro
Welcome to learning about .NET Core on a Mac with Mark Dewey. Together we will creating a simple Coffee Shop app that allows us to save our favorite coffee shops. This will help explore the topics of tooling and MVC using ASP.NET Core. 

This is meant to go hand and hand with the Crash Course `.NET on a Mac`. If you are trying this out no there, feel free to reach out to Mark @ mark@suncoast.io if you have issues or questions


## Required Software
## Setting up the Project

First we need to make a new project. This can be done with the new CLI. 

Open up a terminal, create a new folder and run :

```
dotnet new mvc
```

this will give us a new, blank starter project. You can run it using: 

``` 
dotnet run
```

Take a few seconds to checkout what all the starter gave you.
