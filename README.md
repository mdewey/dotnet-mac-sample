## Intro
Welcome to learning about .NET Core on a Mac with Mark Dewey. Together we will creating a simple Coffee Shop app that allows us to save our favorite coffee shops. This will help explore the topics of tooling and MVC using ASP.NET Core. 

This is meant to go hand and hand with the Crash Course `.NET on a Mac`. If you are trying this out no there, feel free to reach out to Mark @ mark@suncoast.io if you have issues or questions
